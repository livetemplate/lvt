## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Be Specific

❌ **Vague:** "I need help"
✅ **Specific:** "Add products with name:string, price:float, stock:int"

### 2. Provide Context

**Good context includes:**
- Current project state (new/existing)
- What you've already done
- Errors you're seeing
- What you're trying to achieve

Example: "I created posts, ran migrations, but getting 'database locked' error when running app"

### 3. Trust the Workflow

Skills prevent common mistakes automatically:
- ✅ Checks prerequisites
- ✅ Runs migrations
- ✅ Generates sqlc models
- ✅ Wires routes
- ✅ Validates configuration

### 4. Use Workflows for Speed

**Instead of:**
```
"Create app"
"Add resource"
"Add another resource"
"Generate data"
"Run app"
```

**Use:**
```
"Quickstart a blog app"
```
(Does all of the above automatically)

### 5. Ask Follow-Up Questions

Skills are comprehensive - ask for clarification:
- "Why float instead of int for price?"
- "What's the difference between CASCADE and RESTRICT?"
- "Can you explain the CSP header?"
