# lvt:suggest

Analyzes app structure and suggests actionable improvements. Provides prioritized recommendations for features, performance, security, and user experience.

## User Prompts

**When to use:**
- "What should I add to my app?"
- "Suggest improvements for my application"
- "What's missing from my app?"
- "How can I make this better?"
- "What features should I add next?"

**Examples:**
- "Suggest improvements for my blog"
- "What should I add to make this production-ready?"
- "How can I improve performance?"
- "What security improvements do I need?"

## How It Works

### Step 1: Analyze Current State

Use **lvt:resource-inspect** to understand the app:
```bash
lvt resource list
lvt resource describe <table>
```

**Gather context:**
- What resources exist?
- What relationships are present?
- What features are implemented?
- What's the domain/purpose?

### Step 2: Categorize Suggestions

Generate recommendations in these categories:

#### 1. Missing Core Features (P0 - Critical)

**Authentication:**
```
⚠️ No authentication system detected
→ Add user authentication to protect resources
→ Command: lvt gen auth
→ Impact: Security, user management, sessions
```

**Essential Relationships:**
```
⚠️ posts table exists but no comments
→ Add comments to enable reader engagement
→ Command: lvt gen resource comments post_id:references:posts:CASCADE content author
→ Impact: User engagement, community building
```

#### 2. Performance Optimizations (P1 - Important)

**Missing Indexes:**
```
⚠️ No index on posts(created_at)
→ Add index for date-based queries
→ Command: lvt migration create add_posts_created_at_index
→ SQL: CREATE INDEX idx_posts_created_at ON posts(created_at);
→ Impact: Faster list/pagination queries
```

**Query Optimization:**
```
⚠️ N+1 query potential in posts → comments
→ Consider eager loading or denormalization
→ Impact: Reduced database roundtrips
```

#### 3. Security Enhancements (P1 - Important)

**CSRF Protection:**
```
⚠️ Forms lack CSRF protection
→ Add CSRF tokens to all forms
→ Already built-in with auth system
→ Impact: Prevent cross-site request forgery
```

**Input Validation:**
```
⚠️ No field length limits
→ Add validation to prevent abuse
→ Add constraints in migrations
→ Impact: Data integrity, DoS prevention
```

#### 4. UX Improvements (P2 - Nice to have)

**Pagination:**
```
💡 Large lists without pagination
→ Add infinite scroll or page-based navigation
→ Already supported by LiveTemplate
→ Impact: Better performance, usability
```

**Search:**
```
💡 No search functionality
→ Add search to help users find content
→ SQL: WHERE title LIKE ? OR content LIKE ?
→ Impact: Improved user experience
```

**Sorting/Filtering:**
```
💡 No sort or filter controls
→ Add UI controls for sorting/filtering
→ Impact: Better content discovery
```

#### 5. Data Management (P2 - Nice to have)

**Soft Deletes:**
```
💡 Hard deletes with CASCADE
→ Consider soft deletes for audit trail
→ Add deleted_at:time field
→ Impact: Data recovery, audit compliance
```

**Timestamps:**
```
💡 Missing updated_at fields
→ Add updated_at for change tracking
→ Impact: Better data lifecycle management
```

### Step 3: Prioritize Recommendations

**Priority matrix:**

**P0 (Critical - Do now):**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Missing authentication (if handling user data)
- Broken relationships
- Data integrity issues

**P1 (Important - Do soon):**
- Performance bottlenecks
- Missing core features for domain
- UX pain points
- Production readiness gaps

**P2 (Nice to have - Do later):**
- Advanced features
- Polish and refinement
- Optional optimizations

### Step 4: Generate Action Plan

**Format suggestions as actionable steps:**

- Related posts (engagement)
- View counter (analytics)

### E-commerce Domain

**If has: products**
Suggest:
- Reviews/ratings (social proof)
- Inventory tracking (stock management)
- Categories/filters (navigation)
- Search (product discovery)
- Cart persistence (UX)
- Order history (customer service)
- Product images (visual appeal)

### SaaS Domain

## Suggestion Patterns

### Pattern 1: Missing CRUD Relationships

**Detection:** Parent resource without children
**Example:** posts without comments
**Suggestion:**
```
Add comments to enable reader engagement
→ lvt gen resource comments post_id:references:posts:CASCADE content author created_at
→ Impact: Community building, feedback loop
```

### Pattern 2: No Search/Filter

**Detection:** Large datasets without search
**Example:** 100+ products without search
**Suggestion:**
```
Add search functionality to help users find products
→ Add search input to list template
→ Add WHERE clause: WHERE name LIKE ? OR description LIKE ?
→ Impact: Better user experience, faster discovery
```

### Pattern 3: Missing Authentication

**Detection:** User-specific resources without auth
**Example:** tasks, posts with "user_email" but no auth system
**Suggestion:**
```
Add authentication to protect user data
→ lvt gen auth
→ Use auth.RequireAuth middleware on routes
→ Impact: Security, user management
```

### Pattern 4: Performance Issues

**Detection:** Tables > 1000 rows without indexes on common queries
**Example:** posts sorted by created_at without index
**Suggestion:**
```
Add index on created_at for faster sorting
→ lvt migration create add_posts_created_at_index
→ CREATE INDEX idx_posts_created_at ON posts(created_at);
→ Impact: 10-100x faster queries
```

### Pattern 5: Missing Production Features

**Detection:** App ready to deploy but missing prod features
**Example:** No health checks, no monitoring
**Suggestion:**
```
Add production readiness features
→ Health check endpoint
→ Structured logging
→ Error monitoring (Sentry)
→ Database backups (Litestream)
→ Impact: Reliability, observability
```
