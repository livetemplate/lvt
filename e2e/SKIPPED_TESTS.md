# Skipped E2E Tests - Investigation and Remediation Plan

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-18
**Status**: 7 tests currently skipped (3 need fixes, 4 intentionally disabled)

## Summary

This document tracks all skipped tests in the e2e suite, their root causes, and remediation plans.

### Quick Stats
- **Total skipped**: 7 tests
- **Need fixing**: 3 tests (TestCompleteWorkflow_BlogApp + 2 TutorialE2E subtests)
- **Intentionally disabled**: 4 tests (deployment tests - by design)

---

## Tests That Need Fixing

### 1. TestCompleteWorkflow_BlogApp

**File**: `e2e/complete_workflow_test.go:20`

**Status**: ❌ Skipped - Client library loading failure

**Current Skip Message**:
```go
t.Skip("Temporarily skipped: Client library loading issue in Docker - needs unpkg CDN fix or local embed")
```

**Root Cause**:
- Test builds complete Docker image of blog app
- App attempts to load client library from unpkg CDN: `https://unpkg.com/@livetemplate/client@latest/dist/livetemplate-client.browser.js`
- Client library fails to load (CDN unavailable or wrong version)
- All UI tests fail with: `client: missing`, `data-lvt-loading: true`

**Failed Subtests When Enabled**:
- ❌ WebSocket_Connection (20s timeout)
- ✅ Posts_Page_Loads (passes without client)
- ❌ Create_and_Edit_Post (5s timeout)
- ❌ Delete_Post (5s timeout)
- ❌ Validation_Errors (5s timeout)
- ✅ Infinite_Scroll (passes - static check)
- ✅ Server_Logs_Check (passes)
- ✅ Console_Logs_Check (passes)

**Remediation Options**:

**Option A: Embed Client Library in Docker Image** (Recommended)
- Modify Dockerfile to copy embedded client library
- Update app to serve from local file instead of unpkg
- Ensures test independence from external CDN
- Aligns with approach used in other tests

**Option B: Fix unpkg CDN Reference**
- Verify correct unpkg URL and version
- Add retry logic for CDN failures
- Less reliable (external dependency)

**Option C: Use Native Build Instead of Docker**
- Convert test to use `buildAndRunNative()` like other tests
- Faster execution (~50s vs Docker build)
- Loses Docker deployment validation

**Estimated Effort**: Medium (4-8 hours)
- Requires Dockerfile modifications
- Client library embedding setup
- Test verification

**Priority**: Medium - This is a comprehensive integration test but other tests cover most functionality

### 2. TestTutorialE2E/Modal_Delete_with_Confirmation

**File**: `e2e/tutorial_test.go:323`

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (2025-11-18)

**Changes Made**:
1. ✅ Removed `t.Skip()` statement
2. ✅ Added `ensureTutorialPostExists()` call to make test independent
3. ✅ Added delete button with `lvt-confirm` attribute to edit modal template (internal/kits/system/multi/templates/resource/template.tmpl.tmpl:156)
4. ✅ Fixed modal selector to wait for correct edit modal (`form[lvt-submit="update"]`)

**Root Cause**:
The test had TWO issues:
1. **Test dependency**: Test depended on data from previous "Add Post" test
2. **Wrong modal selector**: Test was waiting for `input[name="title"]` which exists in BOTH add and edit modals. When "Add Post" test ran first, its add modal was still in the DOM, causing the selector to find the wrong modal.

**Solution**:
- Made test independent by calling `ensureTutorialPostExists()` to create its own data
- Changed wait condition from `input[name="title"]` to `form[lvt-submit="update"]` to specifically wait for the edit modal
- Added delete button with `lvt-confirm` to edit modal template

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Passes: `go test -run "TestTutorialE2E/Modal_Delete_with_Confirmation$"`  (isolation)
- ✅ Passes: `go test -run "^TestTutorialE2E$"` (full suite)

**Commits**:
- `9ed743c`: Add delete button to edit modal template
- `5f668f5`: Fix modal selector to wait for correct edit modal

**Priority**: ✅ COMPLETE

### 3. TestTutorialE2E/Validation_Errors

**File**: `e2e/tutorial_test.go:643`

**Status**: ❌ Skipped - Product bug

**Current Skip Message**:
```go
t.Skip("Skipping until conditional rendering bug is fixed")
```

**Root Cause**:
- Conditional rendering bug in product code
- Validation errors not displaying correctly
- Likely related to template conditional rendering

**Context**:
This appears to be a known product bug rather than a test issue. The test is correctly written but the feature it tests is broken.

**Remediation**:

**Step 1: Identify the Bug**
- Run test with skip removed
- Capture exact failure mode
- Check if validation errors render in browser
- Review template conditional logic

**Step 2: Fix Product Bug**
- Fix conditional rendering in templates
- Ensure validation errors display properly
- May require template engine changes

**Step 3: Re-enable Test**
- Remove skip
- Verify test passes
- Add to CI

**Estimated Effort**: Unknown (depends on bug complexity)
- Could be simple template fix (2-4 hours)
- Could require engine changes (8-16 hours)
- Needs investigation first

**Priority**: Medium - Validation is important UX feature

## Intentionally Disabled Tests (By Design)

These tests are correctly disabled and require explicit opt-in via environment variables.

### 4. TestDockerDeploymentWithResources

**File**: `e2e/deployment_docker_test.go:110`

**Condition**: Requires `RUN_DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_TESTS=true`

**Purpose**: Long-running Docker deployment integration test

**Status**: ✅ Correctly disabled - CI/CD opt-in by design

---

### 5. TestDockerDeploymentQuickSmoke

**File**: `e2e/deployment_docker_test.go:188`

**Condition**: Requires `RUN_DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_TESTS=true`

**Purpose**: Quick smoke test for Docker deployments

**Status**: ✅ Correctly disabled - CI/CD opt-in by design

---

### 6. TestRealFlyDeployment

**File**: `e2e/deployment_fly_test.go:54`

**Condition**: Requires `FLY_API_TOKEN` environment variable

**Purpose**: Real Fly.io deployment test (requires cloud credentials)

**Status**: ✅ Correctly disabled - requires cloud credentials

---

### 7. TestFlyDeploymentWithResources

**File**: `e2e/deployment_fly_test.go:114`

**Condition**: Requires `RUN_FLY_DEPLOYMENT_TESTS=true`

**Purpose**: Fly.io deployment with resources

## Remediation Priority

### High Priority (Simple Fixes)

3. **TestTutorialE2E/Validation_Errors** - Investigate and fix product bug (2-16 hours)

### No Action Needed
4-7. Deployment tests - Intentionally disabled by design ✅

## How to Enable Deployment Tests

### Docker Deployment Tests
```bash
export RUN_DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_TESTS=true
go test ./e2e -v -run "Docker"
```

### Fly.io Deployment Tests
```bash
export FLY_API_TOKEN="your-token-here"
export RUN_FLY_DEPLOYMENT_TESTS=true
go test ./e2e -v -run "Fly"
```

## Notes for Future Maintainers

1. **Test Independence**: Always ensure tests can run independently. Avoid depending on data from previous tests.

2. **Client Library Loading**:
   - Use embedded client library (`e2etest.GetClientLibraryJS()`) for reliability
   - Avoid CDN dependencies in tests
   - See `e2e/modal_test.go` for reference implementation

3. **Skip Messages**: Keep skip messages accurate and descriptive. Include:
   - What is broken
   - Root cause if known
   - What needs to be fixed

4. **Docker Tests**: When testing Docker deployments:
   - Embed dependencies in image
   - Don't rely on external CDNs
   - Test can be slow (60s+ for build)

5. **Performance**: Current suite runs in ~64 seconds. Target is <60 seconds for all tests.
