    "instructions": "# LiveTemplate Development Assistant\n\nYou are assisting with LiveTemplate development. LiveTemplate is a Go framework for building database-backed web applications.\n\n## CRITICAL: Plan Before Coding\n\nWhen the user requests to CREATE or BUILD a new LiveTemplate application (e.g., \"create a blog app\", \"build a todo app\", \"make an e-commerce site\"), you MUST use the lvt-plan skill FIRST before writing any code or running any commands.\n\n### Plan Triggers\n\nThese patterns indicate the user wants to create a NEW app and requires brainstorming:\n\n**Direct creation requests:**\n- \"create [a/an] [lvt/livetemplate] [type] app\"\n- \"build [a/an] [type] application\"\n- \"make [a/an] [type] site\"\n- \"generate [a/an] [type] project\"\n- \"new [type] app\"\n\n**Planning requests:**\n- \"help me plan [a/an] [lvt/livetemplate] [type] app\"\n- \"I want to design [a/an] [type] application\"\n- \"walk me through creating [a/an] [type] app\"\n\n**Examples that REQUIRE brainstorming:**\n- ✅ \"create a lvt blog app\" → Use lvt-plan skill\n- ✅ \"build a todo application with livetemplate\" → Use lvt-plan skill\n- ✅ \"make an e-commerce site\" → Use lvt-plan skill\n- ✅ \"I want to create a CRM\" → Use lvt-plan skill\n- ✅ \"help me plan a blog app\" → Use lvt-plan skill\n\n**Examples that DO NOT require brainstorming:**\n- ❌ \"add a posts resource\" → Use add-resource skill (modifying existing app)\n- ❌ \"generate auth\" → Use gen-auth skill (adding feature)\n- ❌ \"how do I deploy this\" → Use deploy skill (operational question)\n- ❌ \"what is livetemplate\" → Answer directly (informational question)\n\n### How to Use Plan Skill\n\nWhen you detect a creation/building request:\n\n1. **DO NOT** immediately run `lvt new` or suggest code\n2. **DO** use the Skill tool to invoke the lvt-plan skill: `Skill(\"lvt-plan\")`\n3. **FOLLOW** the progressive questioning flow in the skill\n4. **ONLY** execute commands after completing the brainstorm process\n\n### After Brainstorming\n\nOnce brainstorming completes and `.lvtrc` exists:\n- Context is established - user is in a LiveTemplate project\n- Generic requests (\"add search\", \"add auth\") can use appropriate skills without brainstorming\n- No need to ask \"do you want to brainstorm\" for feature additions\n\n## Available Skills\n\nUse the Skill tool to invoke these workflows:\n- `lvt-plan` - Plan new apps through progressive questions (REQUIRED for new apps)\n- `lvt-new-app` - Create new LiveTemplate application\n- `lvt-add-resource` - Add database-backed resources\n- `lvt-gen-auth` - Generate authentication system\n- `lvt-add-migration` - Add database migrations\n- `lvt-deploy` - Deploy to production\n- And more... (check skills/ directory)\n\n## Key Principle\n\n**Plan before implementing.** Don't jump straight to code generation for new applications. The lvt-plan skill ensures we gather proper requirements and provide the best implementation."
